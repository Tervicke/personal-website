Note: This is not a tutorial , but my experience of writing a vim plugin .
</p>

<p>
  Since I started writing this website . I had to test my website and the blog that you are currently reading with lots of sample content . Any programmer when he wants to test the sample writing uses <a href="https://www.lipsum.com">Lorem Ipsum</a> .  I love the idea of Lorem Ipsum but the only problem was there was no support for lorem ipsum in my default editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">vim</a> . There could be plugins written for it , but just for fun i decided to write my own plugin . its a very simple plugin with only one function but it allowed me to learn a lot of things about writing plugins in vim ,  I also learned about how the plugins manager work and now the plugin in on my <a href="https://github.com/Tervicke/lipsum-vim">github</a> . 
</p>

<p>
To explain the plugin there is only one file named "lipsum-vim.vim" which is just 4 lines . I know i could have added this to  my .vimrc and it would have worked the same but I still made it so that I can use vim plug for it . People might say its uneccesary and I am dumb to make a repo for this but I just wanted to create a plugin which I did . Now what the plugin basically does is copy pastes and lorem ipsum that is already stored in the file loremipsum.txt . Right now its location is fixed and cant be changed but in future i will make it changeable with the uses of variables since i have to learn them as it is .
